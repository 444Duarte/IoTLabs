Microsoft was at Web Summit and on our booth we had IoT Labs running every day, for which you could register in advance. They were a ***HUGE*** success - registrations sold out in less than 4 hours!

So we set out to deliver new labs in Portugal. Well, here they are!

Goal: Allow you to participate and try out Internet of Things (IoT) with **Microsoft** and **Raspberry Pi 3**! 

Take a look at this starting page, and then head to the Labs.

The **IoT Labs** use Windows 10 IoT, typically running on a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3, although other boards are also capable of running Windows 10 IoT. If you will be going through any of these labs you need to first prepare your **development environment**.

## Conclusion & Next Steps
In this IoT Labs, you learned about general IoT practices with Windows 10 IoT, Linux and several development languages like C# and javascript.

As you already understood, IoT can be fun and always takes you into prototyping. There are several projects shared by the community that can help implement you project. We'd like to leave a set of resource you may find usefull.
 * [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/) - Hackster is a community dedicated to learning hardware.
 * [Maker Faire](http://makerfaire.com/) - Maker Faire is the Greatest Show (and Tell) on Earth—a family-friendly festival of invention, creativity and resourcefulness, and a celebration of the Maker movement.
 * [Make:](http://makezine.com/projects/) - Maker Media is a global platform for connecting Makers.
 * [ConnectTheDots.io](http://connectthedots.io) - An open source project created by Microsoft to help you get tiny devices connected to Microsoft Azure IoT and to implement great IoT solutions taking advantage of Microsoft Azure advanced analytic services such as Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Machine Learning
 * [fritzing](http://fritzing.org/) - Fritzing is an open-source hardware initiative that makes electronics accessible as a creative material for anyone.
 * [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/howto/iot/) - The seeds of Instructables germinated at the MIT Media Lab as the future founders of Squid Labs built places to share their projects, connect with others, and make an impact on the world.
 * [DIYhacking](https://diyhacking.com/about-diy-hacking/) - DIY Hacking (Do It Yourself!) is a non-profit Indian organisation working to promote the Maker culture. 

And remember, when you finish any personal project, please share with Microsoft Portugal. We'll provide you guidance and help you and your projecto to get to the next level!
