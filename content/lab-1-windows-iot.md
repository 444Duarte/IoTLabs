![Windows 10 IoT](/images/windows10-iot.png "Windows 10 IoT")

This Internet of Things (IoT) Lab begins by showing you how to use Windows 10 IoT Core to connect sensors and devices. You will then be shown how to connect a device to the Cloud. Next you will be shown how to leverage Microsoft Azure services to collect data and control devices.  



###Lab 1.1: Hello, Windows IoT!
[In this lab](/content/lab-1-1-hello-windows-iot.md) you will create a simple Thing using a Raspberry Pi 3 running Windows 10 IoT Core.
Estimated time to complete: **30-minutes**. 

###Lab 1.2: Setting Up an Azure IoT Hub
[In this lab](/content/lab-1-2-setting-up-an-azure-iot-hub.md) you will provision a new Azure IoT Hub. Once you have the IoT Hub created, you will be able to create a new Azure IoT device that you will use to send telemetry to Azure. Azure IoT devices are software references to physical devices.
Estimated time to complete: **20-minutes**.

###Lab 1.3: Sending Telemetry to the Cloud
[In this lab](/content/lab-1-3-sending-telemetry-to-the-cloud.md) you will write an application that collects data from your Windows IoT board and sends it up to your Azure IoT Hub.
Estimated time to complete: **40-minutes**. 

###Lab 1.4: Visualize IoT Data with Power BI
[In this lab](/content/lab-1-4-visualize-iot-data-with-powerbi.md) you will create visualizations of IoT data using Microsoft Power BI.
Estimated time to complete: **30-minutes**.
