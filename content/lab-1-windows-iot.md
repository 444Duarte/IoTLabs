#Lab 1 - Windows 10 IoT - Connected Nightlight

This Internet of Things (IoT) Lab begins by showing you how to use Windows 10 IoT Core to connect sensors and devices. You will then be shown how to connect a device to the Cloud. Next you will be shown how to leverage Microsoft Azure services to collect data and control devices.  

###Prep Work
[Getting Started](/content/lab-1-getting-started.md) : This is a step-by-step guide to preparing your computer for this workshop. Estimated time to complete: **60-minutes**. 

###Setting Up Your Raspberry Pi 3
The Raspberry Pi 3 is a low cost credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse.
[In this lab](/content/lab-1-setting-up-your-rpi.md) you will install Windows 10 IoT Core on your Raspberry Pi 3. Estimated time to complete: **30-minutes**.

###Lab 1.1: Hello, Windows IoT!
[In this lab](/content/lab-1-1-hello-windows-iot.md) you will create a simple Thing using a Raspberry Pi 3 running Windows 10 IoT Core.
Estimated time to complete: **30-minutes**. 

###Lab 1.2: Setting Up an Azure IoT Hub
[In this lab](/content/lab-1-2-setting-up-an-azure-iot-hub.md) you will provision a new Azure IoT Hub. Once you have the IoT Hub created, you will be able to create a new Azure IoT device that you will use to send telemetry to Azure. Azure IoT devices are software references to physical devices.
Estimated time to complete: **20-minutes**.

###Lab 1.3: Sending Telemetry to the Cloud
[In this lab](/content/lab-1-3-sending-telemetry-to-the-cloud.md) you will write an application that collects data from your Windows IoT board and sends it up to your Azure IoT Hub.
Estimated time to complete: **40-minutes**. 

###Lab 1.4: Visualize IoT Data with Power BI
[In this lab](/content/lab-1-4-visualize-iot-data-with-powerbi.md) you will create visualizations of IoT data using Microsoft Power BI.
Estimated time to complete: **30-minutes**.
