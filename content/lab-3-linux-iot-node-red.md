![Node-RED](/images/node-red.png "Node-RED")

In this lab, you begin by learning what is Node-RED, and the basics of using it with a Raspberry Pi 3 that's running Raspbian. One of the major goals is to connect your device to the cloud by using a Node-RED node that allows you to connect with Azure IoT Hub.

### Lab 3.1: Getting Started With Node-Red
[In this lab](/content/lab-3-1-getting-started-with-node-red) you will install *Node-RED* and *Node-Red node for Azure IoT Hub*. You will interact with the Node-RED editor and understand how to create and design flows.
Estimated time to complete: **15-minutes**. 

### Lab 3.2: Create your first flow
