#Lab 3 - Using Node-RED with Microsoft Azure IoT

In this lab, you begin by learning what is Node-RED, and the basics of using it with a Raspberry Pi 3 that's running Raspbian. One of the major goals is to connect your device to the cloud by using a Node-RED node that allows you to connect with Azure IoT Hub.

### Lab 3.1: Getting Started With Node-Red
[In this lab](/content/lab-3-1-getting-started-with-node-red) you will clone the sample Node.js blink application from GitHub, and use gulp to deploy this application to your Raspberry Pi 3 board. This sample application blinks the LED connected to the board every two seconds.
Estimated time to complete: **5-minutes**. 


### Lab 3.3: Create your first flow

### Lab 3.4: Creating a more advanced Node-RED flow
### Lab 3.5: ???
